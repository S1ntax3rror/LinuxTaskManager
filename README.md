# LinuxTaskManager

A complete, modular Linux process monitor & manager with C core, ANSI‑CLI, JSON daemon, Spring Boot REST API, and Thymeleaf web UI.

## Features
- **C core library**: parses `/proc` into `proc_stat` structs  
- **Interactive CLI**: live, ANSI‑based terminal UI (kill, renice, filter)  
- **Background daemon**: polls core and serves JSON over a UNIX socket  
- **Spring Boot REST API**: exposes process data to the web front end  
- **Thymeleaf Web UI**: dashboard, filtering, and controls in the browser

## Planned Project Structure
We have made a first plan for the Code Structure of our Linux Task Manager Project - it is available under:
https://github.com/S1ntax3rror/LinuxTaskManager/blob/main/ProjectStructure.txt

## Development Plan
A detailed development plan is available under:
https://github.com/S1ntax3rror/LinuxTaskManager/blob/main/DevelopmentPlan.txt
The plan is not completely fixed but gives us a guideline on how we could approach this more complex project
